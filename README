The target runtest will buid Vector Seeker and run on the very small test code mintest.cpp. This will produce an output file tracer.log.

The standard log output here consits of two sections. The first section lists the malloc calls durring the trace. The second section lists the source lines examined by in descending order of number of instructions seen. Then has each instruction listed followed by the function the instruction was found in then then the pairs of vectors. The vector pairs are in the following format <depth in dependance graph, number of executions of instruction>.
